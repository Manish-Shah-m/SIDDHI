            Tell me Siddhi- How so you wish to be adored?
            With whishpered words or silence poured?
            Shall I hold your hand or touch your soul?
            Teach me to make your wishes whole.

            "They say : To love is to learn,
                        and to learn is to listen."

            The rush of hearts, the butterflies refined?
            How does it feel when the moon glows,
            or the sun dips low and the evening slows?

            If love's a prayer, I'll learn each line,
            To praise you in a way divine,
            Your laughter, your tears, I'll hold them all,
            Teach me to catch you if you ever fall.

            Guide me Siddhi, I will follow through,
            Each moment a lesson in loving you,
            With sunsets, stars & skies above,
            Show me how you wished to be loved.

            Siddhi—
if you could feel
even a flicker
of the fire I carry for you,

your knees would forget the ground.
Your breath—
a bird caught mid-sky—
would falter
beneath the weight
of everything I’ve never said aloud.

If you could truly know
how I love you,
your heart would shatter,
not from pain,
but from awe.

You’d collapse
into the truth
like rain into the ocean—
no longer knowing
where you end
and where I begin.

The world would halt.
Clocks would forget how to tick.
Every song ever written
would fall silent
in reverence.

The moon,
so proud, so distant,
would scatter its bones across the black
just to make room
for your name in the stars.

The sun—
once a tyrant of light—
would dim in shame,
realizing
it had never truly warmed
anything the way you warm me
by simply existing.

Siddhi,
I do not love you like mortals do.
I do not love you with skin, or lips, or hands.
I love you
with the ache of galaxies,
with the silence between lightning and thunder,
with the breath God took
before saying, “Let there be light.”

If infinity had a heartbeat,
it would echo mine
whispering your name.
Again.
And again.
And again.

So don’t ask me
how deep this love runs—
ask the stars that died
so you could be born.
Ask the rivers
why they still move
without ever reaching you.
Ask the night
why it weeps
when it remembers
you are not mine.

And if you cry—
know this:
your tears are prayers
my soul has already spoken.`

don’t say a word tonight.
The stars are listening,
and they know
this is the last time
I’ll ever say your name
with breath in my lungs.

The world ends at dawn.
They didn’t tell us,
but I know.
I can feel it—
in the way the moon is holding back tears,
in how the wind sounds like a goodbye
no one’s ready to say.

So let me confess
before the sky folds in on itself—
I have loved you
in silence,
in shadow,
in every heartbeat that dared not speak.

I have loved you
while laughing in crowds,
while pretending you were only
a passing thought,
when you were the whole damn storm
and I stood
drenched in your name.

I have loved you
in the spaces between your words,
in the way you look at the world
like it never hurt you—
even when it did.

And if I could choose
any ending,
any apocalypse,
any final breath—
I would still choose
this moment,
this you,
this truth.

If I could give you anything
before the sky crumbles,
it would be this:
the raw, unfiltered truth
that you were my everything,
even when I was nothing to you.

So hold my hand,
just this once,
as the stars burn out,
as time exhales
and the earth goes still—
let me die knowing
you finally knew.`

not just our studies,
not just these quiet days of becoming someone.
Let’s become us.
Let’s get the jobs,
earn enough not for riches,
but for a life we built with our own hands.
A small home,
big enough for dreams,
small enough to keep us close.

Siddhi- I want to see your parents
smiling beside mine,
our families clinking glasses,
laughing over stories we once only imagined sharing.
Your hand in mine—
not just in love,
but in life.

Let’s wake up together.
Let the light slip in
through half-closed curtains
as we lie tangled in sheets,
your breath on my chest,
time paused in the quiet glow of morning.

Let’s cook together—
your hips brushing mine,
music in the kitchen,
laughing over chopped onions
and burned toast,
dancing barefoot with sauce-stained spoons.

Let’s sit outside,
watch sunsets melt into each other,
every orange sky
a promise that we stayed.
That we chose this,
again and again.

At night,
we’ll watch the moon rise slow—
you wrapped in my arms,
stars scattered like secrets.
I want every night
to end with your skin
pressed against mine,
your breath heavy and close.
Let me bury myself in you—
bite your neck,
sweat into you,
lose and find myself
a hundred times
until sleep steals us both.

I want your name to echo through our home—
not just from my lips,
but from little ones we made.
I want babies with your eyes,
your laugh,
your fire.
Let’s raise them messy,
honest,
free.
Let’s teach them love
by the way I’ll never stop looking at you.

Let’s make a life,
not just a living.
Let’s carve a way out of this chaos—
just you and me,
building something
the world can’t touch.

And when the last light comes—
when our hands are older,
our breaths slower—
let’s sit together,
one final sunset,
your fingers in mine,
our whole story behind us,
and nothing left to say
but I Love You, today, tomorrow & forever.

I never would.

I was waiting for real.
For the kind of love
that doesn’t knock loud—
just opens the door
and says, “I’m home.”

You are not a chapter—
you are the book.
You are not a spark—
you are the fire that stayed lit
when every candle I held
burned out too soon.

Before you,
I knew the shape of loneliness
better than my own skin.
I knew silence that echoed,
nights that stretched empty,
hands that reached
but never landed.

But then—
you.
Not loud, not lightning.
You, like rain after drought.
You, like breath after drowning.

They say you only find
a love like this once—
and they’re right.
This is it.
The kind of love
that doesn’t ask to be written about,
but still ends up in every line.

If I only get one life,
let it be this one.
Let it be the one
where I found you
